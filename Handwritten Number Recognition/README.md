It is a data of 60000 small 28X28 pixels grayscale handwritten images of digits 0-9 from MNIST dataset.
Normalize the pixel values of grayscale images, e.g. rescale them to the range [0,1]. This involves first converting the 
data type from unsigned integers to floats, then dividing the pixel values by the maximum value.

Then defined the CNN model such that it does not overfit the model. Splited my dataset into test and train dataset to 
check and validate the accuracy at last.
